  primarily intended to be used with <https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/generic/index.html>
  , but it is also compatible with any other Vault endpoint that supports the @vault
  write@ command to create and the @vault delete@ command to delete. ~> Important

  state and plan files generated by Terraform, and will appear in the console output
  when Terraform runs. Protect these artifacts accordingly. See <../index.html> for
