    help: (Required) The full logical path from which to request data. To read data
      from the "generic" secret backend mounted in Vault by default, this should be
      prefixed with @secret/@ . Reading from other backends with this data source
      is possible; consult each backend's documentation to see which endpoints support
      the @GET@ method.

about: Reads arbitrary data from a given path in Vault. This resource is primarily
  intended to be used with <https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/generic/index.html>
  , but it is also compatible with any other Vault endpoint that supports the @vault
  read@ command. ~> Important All data retrieved from Vault will be written in cleartext
  to state file generated by Terraform, will appear in the console output when Terraform
  runs, and may be included in plan files if secrets are interpolated into any resource
  attributes. Protect these artifacts accordingly. See <../index.html> for more details.
