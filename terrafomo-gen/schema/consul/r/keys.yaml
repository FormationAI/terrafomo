about: The @consul_keys@ resource writes sets of individual values into Consul. This
  is a powerful way to expose infrastructure details to clients. This resource manages
  individual keys, and thus it can create, update and delete the keys explicitly given.
  However, it is not able to detect and remove additional keys that have been added
  by non-Terraform means. To manage all keys sharing a common prefix, and thus have
  Terraform remove errant keys not present in the configuration, consider using the
  @consul_key_prefix@ resource instead.
