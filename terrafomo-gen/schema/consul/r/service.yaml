about: A high-level resource for creating a Service in Consul. Currently, defining
  health checks for a service is not supported. Most users should not use this resource
  . When using Consul with compute instances, it's better to install <https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/basics.html>
  on these machines and register services via the agent. This ensures that services
  get assigned to the appropriate Consul "nodes" and allows service health to integrate
  with general node health as reported by the agent. To register a non-compute resource,
  such as a hosted database, as a service, as described in <https://www.consul.io/docs/guides/external.html>
  , use <catalog_entry.html> instead, which can create an arbitrary service record
  in the Consul catalog.
