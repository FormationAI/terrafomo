about: The @consul_catalog_services@ data source returns a list of Consul services
  that have been registered with the Consul cluster in a given datacenter.  By specifying
  a different datacenter in the @query_options@ it is possible to retrieve a list
  of services from a different WAN-attached Consul datacenter. This data source is
  different from the @consul_catalog_service@ (singular) data source, which provides
  a detailed response about a specific Consul service.
