about: The Docker provider is used to interact with Docker containers and images.
  It uses the Docker API to manage the lifecycle of Docker containers. Because the
  Docker provider uses the Docker API, it is immediately compatible not only with
  single server Docker but Swarm and any additional Docker-compatible API hosts. Use
  the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.
