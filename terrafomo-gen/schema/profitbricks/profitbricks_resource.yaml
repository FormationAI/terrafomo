about: The resource data source can be used to search for and return any existing
  ProfitBricks resource and optionally their group associations. You can provide a
  string for the resource type (datacenter,image,snapshot,ipblock) and/or resource
  id parameters which will be queries against available resources. If a single match
  is found, it will be returned. If your search results in multiple matches, an error
  will be generated. When this happens, please refine your search string so that it
  is specific enough to return only one result.
