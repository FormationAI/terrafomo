arguments:
  allowed_account_ids:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) List of allowed, white listed, AWS account IDs to prevent you

    required: false
    help: (Optional) Set this to @true@ to force the request to use path-style addressing,
      i.e., @http://s3.amazonaws.com/BUCKET/KEY@ . By default, the S3 client will
      use virtual hosted bucket addressing, @http://BUCKET.s3.amazonaws.com/KEY@ ,
      when possible. Specific to the Amazon S3 service.

    required: false
    help: (Optional) List of forbidden, blacklisted, AWS account IDs to prevent you
      mistakenly using a wrong one (and potentially end up destroying a live environment).
      Conflicts with @allowed_account_ids@ .
    type: Text
  shared_credentials_file:
    required: true
    help: = (Optional) This is the path to the shared credentials file. If this is
