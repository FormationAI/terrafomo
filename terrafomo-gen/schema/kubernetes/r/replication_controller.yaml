about: A Replication Controller ensures that a specified number of pod “replicas”
  are running at any one time. In other words, a Replication Controller makes sure
  that a pod or homogeneous set of pods are always up and available. If there are
  too many pods, it will kill some. If there are too few, the Replication Controller
  will start more.
