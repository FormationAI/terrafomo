arguments:
  _ca_cert_pem:
    required: true
    help: (Required) PEM-encoded certificate data for the CA.
    type: Text
  _ca_private_key_pem:
    required: true
    help: (Required) PEM-encoded private key data for the CA. This can be read from
      a separate file using the @file@ interpolation function.
    type: Text
  _validity_period_hours:
    required: true
    help: (Required) The number of hours after initial issuing that the certificate
      will become invalid.
    type: Text
  _cert_request_pem:
    required: true
    help: (Required) PEM-encoded request certificate data.
    type: Text
  _is_ca_certificate:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) Boolean controlling whether the CA flag will be set in the generated
      certificate. Defaults to @false@ , meaning that the certificate does not represent
      a certificate authority.
    type: Text
  _ca_key_algorithm:
    required: true
    help: (Required) The name of the algorithm for the key provided in @ca_private_key_pem@
      .
    type: Text
  _allowed_uses:
    required: true
    help: (Required) List of keywords each describing a use that is permitted for
      the issued certificate. The valid keywords are listed below.
    type: Text
  _early_renewal_hours:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) If set, the resource will consider the certificate to have expired
      the given number of hours before its actual expiry time. This can be useful
      to deploy an updated certificate in advance of the expiration of the current
      certificate. Note however that the old certificate remains valid until its true
      expiration time, since this resource does not (and cannot) support certificate
      revocation. Note also that this advance update can only be performed should
      the Terraform configuration be applied during the early renewal period.

about: Generates a TLS certificate using a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and signs
  it with a provided certificate authority (CA) private key. Locally-signed certificates
  are generally only trusted by client software when setup to use the provided CA.
  They are normally used in development environments or when deployed internally to
  an organization.
