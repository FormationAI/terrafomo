about: Generates a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) in PEM format, which is the typical
  format used to request a certificate from a certificate authority. This resource
  is intended to be used in conjunction with a Terraform provider for a particular
  certificate authority in order to provision a new certificate. This is a logical
  resource , so it contributes only to the current Terraform state and does not create
  any external managed resources. ~> Compatibility Note From Terraform 0.7.0 to 0.7.4
  this resource was converted to a data source, and the resource form of it was deprecated.
  This turned out to be a design error since a cert request includes a random number
  in the form of the signature nonce, and so the data source form of this resource
  caused non-convergent configuration. The data source form is no longer supported
  as of Terraform 0.7.5 and any users should return to using the resource form.
