about: Generates a secure private key and encodes it as PEM. This resource is primarily
  intended for easily bootstrapping throwaway development environments. ~> Important
  Security Notice The private key generated by this resource will be stored unencrypted
  in your Terraform state file. Use of this resource for production deployments is
  not recommended . Instead, generate a private key file outside of Terraform and
  distribute it securely to the system where Terraform will be run. This is a logical
  resource , so it contributes only to the current Terraform state and does not create
  any external managed resources.
