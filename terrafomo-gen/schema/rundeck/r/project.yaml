  _ssh_key_file_path:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) Like @ssh_key_storage_path@ except that the key is read from
      the Rundeck server's local filesystem, rather than from the key store.
    ignored: false
    type: Text
  _resource_model_source:
    required: true
    help: (Required) Nested block instructing Rundeck on how to determine the set
      of resources (nodes) for this project. The nested block structure is described
      below.
    ignored: false
    type: Text
  _ssh_authentication_type:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) When the SSH-based file copier and executor plugins are used,

  _default_node_executor_plugin:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) The name of a plugin to use to run commands on nodes within this

  _extra_config:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) Behind the scenes a Rundeck project is really an arbitrary set
      of key/value pairs. This map argument allows setting any configuration properties
      that aren't explicitly supported by the other arguments described above, but
      due to limitations of Terraform the key names must be written with slashes in
      place of dots. Do not use this argument to set properties that the above arguments
      set, or undefined behavior will result.
    ignored: false
    type: Text
  _name:
    required: true
    help: (Required) The name of the project, used both in the UI and to uniquely
      identify the project. Must therefore be unique across a single Rundeck installation.

    type: Text
  _default_node_file_copier_plugin:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) The name of a plugin to use to copy files onto nodes within this

  _ssh_key_storage_path:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) When the SSH-based file copier and executor plugins are used,
      the location within Rundeck's key store where the SSH private key can be found.
      Private keys can be uploaded to rundeck using the @rundeck_private_key@ resource.
