arguments:
  _source_tags:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) A list of source tags for this firewall. Can't be used for @EGRESS@
      .
    type: Text
  _direction:
    required: false
    help: (Optional, </docs/providers/google/index.html#beta-features> ) Direction
      of traffic to which this firewall applies; One of @INGRESS@ or @EGRESS@ . Defaults
      to @INGRESS@ .
    type: Text
  _project:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) The project in which the resource belongs. If it is not provided,
      the provider project is used.
    type: Text
  _target_tags:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) A list of target tags for this firewall.
    type: Text
  _name:
    required: true
    help: (Required) A unique name for the resource, required by GCE. Changing this
      forces a new resource to be created.
    type: Text
  _source_ranges:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) A list of source CIDR ranges that this firewall applies to. Can't
      be used for @EGRESS@ .
    type: Text
  _description:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) Textual description field.
    type: Text
  _priority:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) The priority for this firewall. Ranges from 0-65535, inclusive.
      Defaults to 1000. Firewall resources with lower priority values have higher
      precedence (e.g. a firewall resource with a priority value of 0 takes effect
      over all other firewall rules with a non-zero priority).
    type: Text
  _source_service_accounts:
    required: false
    help: (Optional, </docs/providers/google/index.html#beta-features> ) A list of
      service accounts such that the firewall will apply only to traffic originating
      from an instance with a service account in this list. Source service accounts
      cannot be used to control traffic to an instance's external IP address because
      service accounts are associated with an instance, not an IP address. @source_ranges@
      can be set at the same time as @source_service_accounts@ . If both are set,
      the firewall will apply to traffic that has source IP address within @source_ranges@
      OR the source IP belongs to an instance with service account listed in @source_service_accounts@
      . The connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to
      apply. @source_service_accounts@ cannot be used at the same time as @source_tags@
      or @target_tags@ .
    type: Text
  _destination_ranges:
    required: false
    help: (Optional, </docs/providers/google/index.html#beta-features> ) A list of
      destination CIDR ranges that this firewall applies to. Can't be used for @INGRESS@
      .
    type: Text
  _allow:

    type: Text
  _network:
    required: true
    help: (Required) The name or self_link of the network to attach this firewall
      to.
    type: Text
  _target_service_accounts:
    required: false
    help: (Optional, </docs/providers/google/index.html#beta-features> ) A list of
      service accounts indicating sets of instances located in the network that may
      make network connections as specified in @allow@ . @target_service_accounts@
      cannot be used at the same time as @source_tags@ or @target_tags@ . If neither
      @target_service_accounts@ nor @target_tags@ are specified, the firewall rule
      applies to all instances on the specified network.
    type: Text
  _deny:
    required: false
    help: (Optional, </docs/providers/google/index.html#beta-features> ) Can be specified
      multiple times for each deny rule. Each deny block supports fields documented
