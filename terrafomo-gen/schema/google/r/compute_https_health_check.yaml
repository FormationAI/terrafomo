about: ! 'Manages an HTTPS health check within GCE. This is used to monitor instances
  behind load balancers. Timeouts or HTTPS errors cause the instance to be removed
  from the pool. For more information, see <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/health-checks#legacy_health_checks>
  and <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/httpsHealthChecks> .
  ~> Note: HTTPSHealthChecks/HttpHealthChecks are legacy health checks. The newer
  </docs/providers/google/r/compute_health_check.html> should be preferred for all
  uses except except <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/network/>
  which still require the legacy HttpHealthChecks.'
