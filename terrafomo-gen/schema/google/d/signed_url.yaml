about: The Google Cloud storage signed URL data source generates a signed URL for
  a given storage object. Signed URLs provide a way to give time-limited read or write
  access to anyone in possession of the URL, regardless of whether they have a Google
  account. For more info about signed URL's is available <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls>
