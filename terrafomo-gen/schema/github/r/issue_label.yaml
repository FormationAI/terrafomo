about: Provides a GitHub issue label resource. This resource allows you to create
  and manage issue labels within your Github organization. Issue labels are keyed
  off of their "name", so pre-existing issue labels result in a 422 HTTP error if
  they exist outside of Terraform. Normally this would not be an issue, except new
  repositories are created with a "default" set of labels, and those labels easily
  conflict with custom ones. This resource will first check if the label exists, and
  then issue an update, otherwise it will create.
