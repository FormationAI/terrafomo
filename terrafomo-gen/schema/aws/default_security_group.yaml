about: Provides a resource to manage the default AWS Security Group. For EC2 Classic
  accounts, each region comes with a Default Security Group. Additionally, each VPC
  created in AWS comes with a Default Security Group that can be managed, but not
  destroyed. This is an advanced resource , and has special caveats to be aware of
  when using it. Please read this document in its entirety before using this resource.
  The @aws_default_security_group@ behaves differently from normal resources, in that
  Terraform does not create this resource, but instead "adopts" it into management.
  We can do this because these default security groups cannot be destroyed, and are
  created with a known set of default ingress/egress rules. When Terraform first adopts
  the Default Security Group, it immediately removes all ingress and egress rules
  in the Security Group . It then proceeds to create any rules specified in the configuration.
  This step is required so that only the rules specified in the configuration are
  created. This resource treats it's inline rules as absolute; only the rules defined
  inline are created, and any additions/removals external to this resource will result
  in diff shown. For these reasons, this resource is incompatible with the @aws_security_group_rule@
  resource. For more information about Default Security Groups, see the AWS Documentation
  on <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html#default-security-group>
