about: ! '@aws_region@ provides details about a specific AWS region. As well as validating
  a given region name (and optionally obtaining its endpoint) this resource can be
  used to discover the name of the region configured within the provider. The latter
  can be useful in a child module which is inheriting an AWS provider configuration
  from its parent module.'
