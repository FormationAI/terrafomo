about: ! 'Provides a resource to manage a Default VPC Routing Table. Each VPC created
  in AWS comes with a Default Route Table that can be managed, but not destroyed.
  This is an advanced resource , and has special caveats to be aware of when using
  it. Please read this document in its entirety before using this resource. It is
  recommended you do not use both @aws_default_route_table@ to manage the default
  route table and use the @aws_main_route_table_association@ , due to possible conflict
  in routes. The @aws_default_route_table@ behaves differently from normal resources,
  in that Terraform does not create this resource, but instead attempts to "adopt"
  it into management. We can do this because each VPC created has a Default Route
  Table that cannot be destroyed, and is created with a single route. When Terraform
  first adopts the Default Route Table, it immediately removes all defined routes
  . It then proceeds to create any routes specified in the configuration. This step
  is required so that only the routes specified in the configuration present in the
  Default Route Table. For more information about Route Tables, see the AWS Documentation
  on <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Route_Tables.html#Route_Replacing_Main_Table>
  . For more information about managing normal Route Tables in Terraform, see our
  documentation on </docs/providers/aws/r/route_table.html> . ~> NOTE on Route Tables
  and Routes: Terraform currently provides both a standalone <route.html> and a Route
  Table resource with routes defined in-line. At this time you cannot use a Route
  Table with in-line routes in conjunction with any Route resources. Doing so will
  cause a conflict of rule settings and will overwrite routes.'
