about: Provides a resource to manage the accepter's side of a cross-account VPC Peering
  Connection. When a cross-account (requester's AWS account differs from the accepter's
  AWS account) VPC Peering Connection is created, a VPC Peering Connection resource
  is automatically created in the accepter's account. The requester can use the @aws_vpc_peering_connection@
  resource to manage its side of the connection and the accepter can use the @aws_vpc_peering_connection_accepter@
  resource to "adopt" its side of the connection into management.
