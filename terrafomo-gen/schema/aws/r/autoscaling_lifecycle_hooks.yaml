about: ! 'Provides an AutoScaling Lifecycle Hook resource. ~> NOTE: Terraform has
  two types of ways you can add lifecycle hooks - via the @initial_lifecycle_hook@
  attribute from the </docs/providers/aws/r/autoscaling_group.html> resource, or via
  this one. Hooks added via this resource will not be added until the autoscaling
  group has been created, and depending on your </docs/providers/aws/r/autoscaling_group.html#waiting-for-capacity>
  settings, after the initial instances have been launched, creating unintended behavior.
  If you need hooks to run on all instances, add them with @initial_lifecycle_hook@
  in </docs/providers/aws/r/autoscaling_group.html> , but take care to not duplicate
  those hooks with this resource.'
