about: Provides a resource to manage the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/default-vpc.html>
  in the current region. For AWS accounts created after 2013-12-04, each region comes
  with a Default VPC. This is an advanced resource , and has special caveats to be
  aware of when using it. Please read this document in its entirety before using this
  resource. The @aws_default_vpc@ behaves differently from normal resources, in that
  Terraform does not create this resource, but instead "adopts" it into management.
