  routing table. ~> NOTE on VPC Endpoints and VPC Endpoint Route Table Associations:
  Terraform provides both a standalone VPC Endpoint Route Table Association (an association
  between a VPC endpoint and a single @route_table_id@ ) and a <vpc_endpoint.html>
  resource with a @route_table_ids@ attribute. Do not use the same route table ID
  in both a VPC Endpoint resource and a VPC Endpoint Route Table Association resource.
  Doing so will cause a conflict of associations and will overwrite the association.'
