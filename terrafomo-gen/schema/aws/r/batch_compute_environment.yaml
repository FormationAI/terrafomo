about: ! 'Creates a AWS Batch compute environment. Compute environments contain the
  Amazon ECS container instances that are used to run containerized batch jobs. For

  set @depends_on@ to the related @aws_iam_role_policy_attachment@ ; otherwise, the
  policy may be destroyed too soon and the compute environment will then get stuck
  in the @DELETING@ state, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/troubleshooting.html>
