  and ASG Attachments: Terraform currently provides both a standalone ASG Attachment
  resource (describing an ASG attached to an ELB), and an <autoscaling_group.html>
  with @load_balancers@ defined in-line. At this time you cannot use an ASG with in-line
  load balancers in conjunction with an ASG Attachment resource. Doing so will cause
  a conflict and will overwrite attachments.'
