  _block_duration_minutes:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) The required duration for the Spot instances, in minutes. This
      value must be a multiple of 60 (60, 120, 180, 240, 300, or 360). The duration
      period starts as soon as your Spot instance receives its instance ID. At the
      end of the duration period, Amazon EC2 marks the Spot instance for termination
      and provides a Spot instance termination notice, which gives the instance a
      two-minute warning before it terminates. Note that you can't specify an Availability
      Zone group or a launch group if you specify a duration.

  _launch_group:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) A launch group is a group of spot instances that launch together
      and terminate together. If left empty instances are launched and terminated
      individually.

  _wait_for_fulfillment:

  _instance_interruption_behavior:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) Indicates whether a Spot instance stops or terminates when it

about: ! 'Provides an EC2 Spot Instance Request resource. This allows instances to
  be requested on the spot market. Terraform always creates Spot Instance Requests
  with a @persistent@ type, which means that for the duration of their lifetime, AWS
  will launch an instance with the configured details if and when the spot market
  will accept the requested price. On destruction, Terraform will make an attempt
  to terminate the associated Spot Instance if there is one present. ~> NOTE: Because
  their behavior depends on the live status of the spot market, Spot Instance Requests
  have a unique lifecycle that makes them behave differently than other Terraform
  resources. Most importantly: there is no guarantee that a Spot Instance exists to
  fulfill the request at any given point in time. See the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-spot-instances.html>
  for more information.'
