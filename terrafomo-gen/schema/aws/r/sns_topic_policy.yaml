about: ! 'Provides an SNS topic policy resource ~> NOTE: If a Principal is specified
  as just an AWS account ID rather than an ARN, AWS silently converts it to the ARN
  for the root user, causing future terraform plans to differ. To avoid this problem,
  just specify the full ARN, e.g. @arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root@'
