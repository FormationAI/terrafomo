  . Changes to an MQ Broker can occur when you change a parameter, such as @configuration@
  or @user@ , and are reflected in the next maintenance window. Because of this, Terraform
  may report a difference in its planning phase because a modification has not yet
  taken place. You can use the @apply_immediately@ flag to instruct the service to
  apply the change immediately (see documentation below). ~> Note: using @apply_immediately@
  can result in a brief downtime as the broker reboots. ~> Note: All arguments including
  the username and password will be stored in the raw state as plain-text. </docs/state/sensitive-data.html>
