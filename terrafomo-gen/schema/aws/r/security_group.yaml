about: ! 'Provides a security group resource. ~> NOTE on Security Groups and Security
  Group Rules: Terraform currently provides both a standalone <security_group_rule.html>
  (a single @ingress@ or @egress@ rule), and a Security Group resource with @ingress@
  and @egress@ rules defined in-line. At this time you cannot use a Security Group
  with in-line rules in conjunction with any Security Group Rule resources. Doing
  so will cause a conflict of rule settings and will overwrite rules.'
