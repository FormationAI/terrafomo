about: ! 'Provides a security group rule resource. Represents a single @ingress@ or
  @egress@ group rule, which can be added to external Security Groups. ~> NOTE on
  Security Groups and Security Group Rules: Terraform currently provides both a standalone
  Security Group Rule resource (a single @ingress@ or @egress@ rule), and a <security_group.html>
  with @ingress@ and @egress@ rules defined in-line. At this time you cannot use a
  Security Group with in-line rules in conjunction with any Security Group Rule resources.
  Doing so will cause a conflict of rule settings and will overwrite rules.'
