about: ! 'Attaches a Managed IAM Policy to user(s), role(s), and/or group(s) !> WARNING:
  The aws_iam_policy_attachment resource creates exclusive attachments of IAM policies.
  Across the entire AWS account, all of the users/roles/groups to which a single policy
  is attached must be declared by a single aws_iam_policy_attachment resource. This
  means that even any users/roles/groups that have the attached policy via some mechanism
  other than Terraform will have that attached policy revoked by Terraform. Consider
  @aws_iam_role_policy_attachment@ , @iam_user_policy_attachment@ , or @iam_group_policy_attachment@
  instead. These resources do not enforce exclusive attachment of an IAM policy.'
