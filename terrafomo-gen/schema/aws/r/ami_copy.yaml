about: The "AMI copy" resource allows duplication of an Amazon Machine Image (AMI),
  including cross-region copies. If the source AMI has associated EBS snapshots, those
  will also be duplicated along with the AMI. This is useful for taking a single AMI
  provisioned in one region and making it available in another for a multi-region
  deployment. Copying an AMI can take several minutes. The creation of this resource
  will block until the new AMI is available for use on new instances.
