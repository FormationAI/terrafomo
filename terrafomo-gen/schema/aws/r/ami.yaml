about: The AMI resource allows the creation and management of a completely-custom
  Amazon Machine Image (AMI). If you just want to duplicate an existing AMI, possibly
  copying it to another region, it's better to use @aws_ami_copy@ instead. If you
  just want to share an existing AMI with another AWS account, it's better to use
  @aws_ami_launch_permission@ instead.
