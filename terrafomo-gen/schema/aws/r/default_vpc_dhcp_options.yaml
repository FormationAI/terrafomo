about: Provides a resource to manage the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html#AmazonDNS>
  in the current region. Each AWS region comes with a default set of DHCP options.
  This is an advanced resource , and has special caveats to be aware of when using
  it. Please read this document in its entirety before using this resource. The @aws_default_vpc_dhcp_options@
  behaves differently from normal resources, in that Terraform does not create this
  resource, but instead "adopts" it into management.
