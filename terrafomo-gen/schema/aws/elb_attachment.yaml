about: ! 'Provides an Elastic Load Balancer Attachment resource. ~> NOTE on ELB Instances
  and ELB Attachments: Terraform currently provides both a standalone ELB Attachment
  resource (describing an instance attached to an ELB), and an <elb.html> with @instances@
  defined in-line. At this time you cannot use an ELB with in-line instances in conjunction
  with an ELB Attachment resource. Doing so will cause a conflict and will overwrite
  attachments.'
