about: Provides a resource to manage the default AWS Network ACL. VPC Only. Each VPC
  created in AWS comes with a Default Network ACL that can be managed, but not destroyed.
  This is an advanced resource , and has special caveats to be aware of when using
  it. Please read this document in its entirety before using this resource. The @aws_default_network_acl@
  behaves differently from normal resources, in that Terraform does not create this
  resource, but instead attempts to "adopt" it into management. We can do this because
  each VPC created has a Default Network ACL that cannot be destroyed, and is created
  with a known set of default rules. When Terraform first adopts the Default Network
  ACL, it immediately removes all rules in the ACL . It then proceeds to create any
  rules specified in the configuration. This step is required so that only the rules
  specified in the configuration are created. This resource treats its inline rules
  as absolute; only the rules defined inline are created, and any additions/removals
  external to this resource will result in diffs being shown. For these reasons, this
  resource is incompatible with the @aws_network_acl_rule@ resource. For more information
  about Network ACLs, see the AWS Documentation on <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_ACLs.html>
