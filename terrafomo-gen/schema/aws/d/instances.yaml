about: ! 'Use this data source to get IDs or IPs of Amazon EC2 instances to be referenced
  elsewhere, e.g. to allow easier migration from another management solution or to
  make it easier for an operator to connect through bastion host(s). -> Note: It''s
  a best practice to expose instance details via <https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/outputs.html>
  and <https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/remote.html> and use <https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/terraform/d/remote_state.html>
  data source instead if you manage referenced instances via Terraform. ~> Note: It''s
  strongly discouraged to use this data source for querying ephemeral instances (e.g.
  managed via autoscaling group), as the output may change at any time and you''d
  need to re-run @apply@ every time an instance comes up or dies.'
