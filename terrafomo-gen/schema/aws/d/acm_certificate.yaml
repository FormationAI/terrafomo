about: Use this data source to get the ARN of a certificate in AWS Certificate Manager
  (ACM). The process of requesting and verifying a certificate in ACM requires some
  manual steps, which means that Terraform cannot automate the creation of ACM certificates.
  But using this data source, you can reference them by domain without having to hard
  code the ARNs as input.
