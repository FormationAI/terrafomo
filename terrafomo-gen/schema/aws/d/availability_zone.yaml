about: ! '@aws_availability_zone@ provides details about a specific availability zone
  (AZ) in the current region. This can be used both to validate an availability zone
  given in a variable and to split the AZ name into its component parts of an AWS
  region and an AZ identifier letter. The latter may be useful e.g. for implementing
  a consistent subnet numbering scheme across several regions by mapping both the
  region and the subnet letter to network numbers. This is different from the @aws_availability_zones@
  (plural) data source, which provides a list of the available zones.'
