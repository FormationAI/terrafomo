      Useful if previous attempts failed, but use this option only as a last resort,
      as this can result in data loss . See <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-detaching-volume.html>

    help: (Optional, Boolean) Set this to true if you do not wish to detach the volume

      instance which has volumes created by some other means attached.

about: ! 'Provides an AWS EBS Volume Attachment as a top level resource, to attach
  and detach volumes from AWS Instances. ~> NOTE on EBS block devices: If you use
  @ebs_block_device@ on an @aws_instance@ , Terraform will assume management over
  the full set of non-root EBS block devices for the instance, and treats additional
  block devices as drift. For this reason, @ebs_block_device@ cannot be mixed with
  external @aws_ebs_volume@ + @aws_ebs_volume_attachment@ resources for a given instance.'
