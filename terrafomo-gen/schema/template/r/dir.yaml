about: Renders a directory containing templates into a separate directory of corresponding
  rendered files. @template_dir@ is similar to <../d/file.html> but it walks a given
  source directory and treats every file it encounters as a template, rendering it
  to a corresponding file in the destination directory. ~> Note When working with
  local files, Terraform will detect the resource as having been deleted each time
  a configuration is applied on a new machine where the destination dir is not present
  and will generate a diff to create it. This may cause "noise" in diffs in environments
  where configurations are routinely applied by many different users or within automation
  systems.
