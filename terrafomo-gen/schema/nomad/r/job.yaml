about: Manages a job registered in Nomad. This can be used to initialize your cluster
  with system jobs, common services, and more. In day to day Nomad use it is common
  for developers to submit jobs to Nomad directly, such as for general app deployment.
  In addition to these apps, a Nomad cluster often runs core system services that
  are ideally setup during infrastructure creation. This resource is ideal for the
  latter type of job, but can be used to manage any job within Nomad.
