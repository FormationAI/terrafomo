about: ! 'Creates a new network Security Group Rule to be associated with a number
  of given Security Groups. ~> NOTE on Security Group Rules : for usability purposes;
  Terraform allows the addition of a single Security Group Rule to multiple Security
  Groups, despite it having to define each rule individually per Security Group on
  Azure. As a result; in the event that one of the Rules on one of the Groups is modified
  by external factors, Terraform cannot reason as to whether or not that change should
  be propagated to the others; let alone choose one changed Rule configuration over
  another in case of a conflic. As such; @terraform refresh@ only checks that the
  rule is still defined for each of the specified @security_group_names@ ; ignoring
  the actual parameters of the Rule and not updating the state with regards to them.'
