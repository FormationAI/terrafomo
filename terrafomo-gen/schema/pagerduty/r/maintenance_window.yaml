  is used to temporarily disable one or more services for a set period of time. No
  incidents will be triggered and no notifications will be received while a service
  is disabled by a maintenance window. Maintenance windows are specified to start
  at a certain time and end after they have begun. Once started, a maintenance window
  cannot be deleted; it can only be ended immediately to re-enable the service.
