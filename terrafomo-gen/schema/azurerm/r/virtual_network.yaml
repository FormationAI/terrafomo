about: ! 'Creates a new virtual network including any configured subnets. Each subnet
  can optionally be configured with a security group to be associated with the subnet.
  ~> NOTE on Virtual Networks and Subnet''s: Terraform currently provides both a standalone
  <subnet.html> , and allows for Subnets to be defined in-line within the <virtual_network.html>
  . At this time you cannot use a Virtual Network with in-line Subnets in conjunction
  with any Subnet resources. Doing so will cause a conflict of Subnet configurations
  and will overwrite Subnet''s.'
