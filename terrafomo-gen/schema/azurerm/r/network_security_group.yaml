about: ! 'Manages a network security group that contains a list of network security
  rules.  Network security groups enable inbound or outbound traffic to be enabled
  or denied. ~> NOTE on Network Security Groups and Network Security Rules: Terraform
  currently provides both a standalone <network_security_rule.html> , and allows for
  Network Security Rules to be defined in-line within the <network_security_group.html>
  . At this time you cannot use a Network Security Group with in-line Network Security
  Rules in conjunction with any Network Security Rule resources. Doing so will cause
  a conflict of rule settings and will overwrite rules.'
