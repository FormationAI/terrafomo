about: The Vault provider allows Terraform to read from, write to, and configure <https://vaultproject.io/>
  . ~> Important Interacting with Vault from Terraform causes any secrets that you
  read and write to be persisted in both Terraform's state file and in any generated
  plan files. For any Terraform module that reads or writes Vault secrets, these files
  should be treated as sensitive and protected accordingly. This provider serves two
  pretty-distinct use-cases, which each have their own security trade-offs and caveats
  that are covered in the sections that follow. Consider these carefully before using
  this provider within your Terraform configuration.
