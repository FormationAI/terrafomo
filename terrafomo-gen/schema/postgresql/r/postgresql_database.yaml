  _allow_connections:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) If @false@ then no one can connect to this database. The default

  _lc_ctype:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) Character classification ( @LC_CTYPE@ ) to use in the database.
      This affects the categorization of characters, e.g. lower, upper and digit.
      If unset or set to an empty string the default character classification is set
      to @C@ .  If set to @DEFAULT@ Terraform will use the character classification
      of the specified @template@ database.  Changing this value will force the creation
      of a new resource as this value can only be changed when a database is created.
    ignored: false
    type: Text
  _encoding:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) Character set encoding to use in the database. Specify a string
      constant (e.g. @UTF8@ or @SQL_ASCII@ ), or an integer encoding number.  If unset
      or set to an empty string the default encoding is set to @UTF8@ .  If set to
      @DEFAULT@ Terraform will use the same encoding as the template database.  Changing
      this value will force the creation of a new resource as this value can only
      be changed when a database is created.
    ignored: false
    type: Text
  _template:
    required: false
    help: ! '(Optional) The name of the template database from which to create the
      database, or @DEFAULT@ to use the default template ( @template0@ ).  NOTE: the
      default in Terraform is @template0@ , not @template1@ .  Changing this value
      will force the creation of a new resource as this value can only be changed
      when a database is created.'

    type: Text
  _tablespace_name:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) The name of the tablespace that will be associated with the database,
      or @DEFAULT@ to use the template database's tablespace.  This tablespace will
      be the default tablespace used for objects created in this database.

  _is_template:

    help: (Optional) If @true@ , then this database can be cloned by any user with

      owner of the database can clone it.
    ignored: false

  _lc_collate:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) Collation order ( @LC_COLLATE@ ) to use in the database.  This
      affects the sort order applied to strings, e.g. in queries with @ORDER BY@ ,
      as well as the order used in indexes on text columns. If unset or set to an
      empty string the default collation is set to @C@ .  If set to @DEFAULT@ Terraform
      will use the same collation order as the specified @template@ database.  Changing
      this value will force the creation of a new resource as this value can only
      be changed when a database is created.
    ignored: false
    type: Text
  _connection_limit:

    help: (Optional) The role name of the user who will own the database, or @DEFAULT@
      to use the default (namely, the user executing the command). To create a database
      owned by another role or to change the owner of an existing database, you must
