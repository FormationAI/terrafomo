  As well as validating a given Circonus ID, this resource can be used to discover
  the additional details about a collector configured within the provider.  The results
  of a @circonus_collector@ API call can return more than one collector per Circonus
  ID.  Details of each individual collector in the group of collectors can be found
  via the @details@ attribute described below. ~> NOTE regarding @cirocnus_collector@
  : The @circonus_collector@ data source actually queries and operates on Circonus
  "brokers" at the broker group level. The @circonus_collector@ is simply a renamed
  Circonus "broker" to make it clear what the function of the "broker" actually does:
  act as a fan-in agent that either pulls or has metrics pushed into it and funneled
  back through Circonus.'
