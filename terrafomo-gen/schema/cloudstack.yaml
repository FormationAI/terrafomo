about: The CloudStack provider is used to interact with the many resources supported
  by CloudStack. The provider needs to be configured with a URL pointing to a running
  CloudStack API and the proper credentials before it can be used. In order to provide
  the required configuration options you can either supply values for the @api_url@
  , @api_key@ and @secret_key@ fields, or for the @config@ and @profile@ fields. A
  combination of both is not allowed and will not work. Use the navigation to the
  left to read about the available resources.
