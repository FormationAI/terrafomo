about: ! 'The @vsphere_distributed_port_group@ resource can be used to manage vSphere
  distributed virtual port groups. These port groups are connected to distributed
  virtual switches, which can be managed by the </docs/providers/vsphere/r/distributed_virtual_switch.html>
  resource. Distributed port groups can be used as networks for virtual machines,
  allowing VMs to use the networking supplied by a distributed virtual switch (DVS),
  with a set of policies that apply to that individual newtork, if desired. For an
  overview on vSphere networking concepts, see <https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.networking.doc/GUID-2B11DBB8-CB3C-4AFF-8885-EFEA0FC562F4.html>
