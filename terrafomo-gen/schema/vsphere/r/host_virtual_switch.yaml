about: The @vsphere_host_virtual_switch@ resource can be used to manage vSphere standard
  switches on an ESXi host. These switches can be used as a backing for standard port
  groups, which can be managed by the </docs/providers/vsphere/r/host_port_group.html>
  resource. For an overview on vSphere networking concepts, see <https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.networking.doc/GUID-2B11DBB8-CB3C-4AFF-8885-EFEA0FC562F4.html>
