about: The @vsphere_vmfs_datastore@ resource can be used to create and manage VMFS
  datastores on an ESXi host or a set of hosts. The resource supports using any SCSI
  device that can generally be used in a datastore, such as local disks, or disks
  presented to a host or multiple hosts over Fibre Channel or iSCSI. Devices can be
  specified manually, or discovered using the </docs/providers/vsphere/d/vmfs_disks.html>
  data source.
