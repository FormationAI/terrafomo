    help: (Required) The path of the folder to be created. This is relative to the
      root of the type of folder you are creating, and the supplied datacenter. For
      example, given a default datacenter of @default-dc@ , a folder of type @vm@
      (denoting a virtual machine folder), and a supplied folder of @terraform-test-folder@
      , the resulting path would be @/default-dc/vm/terraform-test-folder@ .

about: The @vsphere_folder@ resource can be used to manage vSphere inventory folders.
  The resource supports creating folders of the 5 major types - datacenter folders,
  host and cluster folders, virtual machine folders, datastore folders, and network
  folders. Paths are always relative to the specific type of folder you are creating.
  Subfolders are discovered by parsing the relative path specified in @name@ , so
  @foo/bar@ will create a folder named @bar@ in the parent folder @foo@ , as long
  as that folder exists.
