about: The @vsphere_file@ resource can be used to upload files (such as virtual disk
  files) from the host machine that Terraform is running on to a target datastore.  The
  resource can also be used to copy files between datastores, or from one location
  to another on the same datastore. Updates to destination parameters such as @datacenter@
  , @datastore@ , or @destination_file@ will move the managed file a new destination
  based on the values of the new settings.  If any source parameter is changed, such
  as @source_datastore@ , @source_datacenter@ or @source_file@ ), the resource will
  be re-created. Depending on if destination parameters are being changed as well,
  this may result in the destination file either being overwritten or deleted at the
  old location.
