about: Provides a VMware vSphere virtual machine file resource. This can be used to
  upload files (e.g. vmdk disks) from the Terraform host machine to a remote vSphere.  The
  file resource can also be used to copy files within vSphere.  Files can be copied
  between Datacenters and/or Datastores. Updates to file resources will handle moving
  a file to a new destination (datacenter and/or datastore and/or destination_file).  If
  any source parameter (e.g. @source_datastore@ , @source_datacenter@ or @source_file@
  ) are changed, this results in a new resource (new file uploaded or copied and old
  one being deleted).
