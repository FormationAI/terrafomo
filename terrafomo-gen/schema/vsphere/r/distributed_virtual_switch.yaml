about: ! 'The @vsphere_distributed_virtual_switch@ resource can be used to manage
  VMware Distributed Virtual Switches. An essential component of a distributed, scalable
  VMware datacenter, the vSphere Distributed Virtual Switch (DVS) provides centralized
  management and monitoring of the networking configuration of all the hosts that
  are associated with the switch. In addition to adding port groups (see the </docs/providers/vsphere/r/distributed_port_group.html>
  resource) that can be used as networks for virtual machines, a DVS can be configured
  to perform advanced high availability, traffic shaping, network monitoring, and
  more. For an overview on vSphere networking concepts, see <https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.networking.doc/GUID-2B11DBB8-CB3C-4AFF-8885-EFEA0FC562F4.html>
