about: ! 'The @vsphere_virtual_machine_snapshot@ resource can be used to manage snapshots
  for a virtual machine. For more information on managing snapshots and how they work
  in VMware, see <https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc/GUID-CA948C69-7F58-4519-AEB1-739545EA94E5.html>
  . ~> NOTE: A snapshot in VMware differs from traditional disk snapshots, and can
  contain the actual running state of the virtual machine, data for all disks that
  have not been set to be independent from the snapshot (including ones that have
  been attached via the </docs/providers/vsphere/r/virtual_machine.html#attach> parameter
  to the @vsphere_virtual_machine@  @disk@ sub-resource), and even the configuration
  of the virtual machine at the time of the snapshot. Virtual machine, disk activity,
  and configuration changes post-snapshot are not included in the original state.
  Use this resource with care! Neither VMware nor HashiCorp recommends retaining snapshots
  for a extended period of time and does NOT recommend using them as as backup feature.
