  _region:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) The region in which to obtain the V2 Compute client. A Compute
      client is needed to create a floating IP that can be used with a compute instance.
      If omitted, the @region@ argument of the provider is used. Changing this creates
      a new floating IP (which may or may not have a different address).

about: Manages a V2 floating IP resource within OpenStack Nova (compute) that can
  be used for compute instances. These are similar to Neutron (networking) floating
  IP resources, but only networking floating IPs can be used with load balancers.
