arguments:
  _region:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) The region in which to create the container. If omitted, the
      @region@ argument of the provider is used. Changing this creates a new container.
    type: Text
  _source:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) A string representing the local path of a file which will be
      used as the object's content. Conflicts with @source@ and @copy_from@ .
    type: Text
  _object_manifest:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) A string set to specify that this is a dynamic large object manifest
      object. The value is the container and object name prefix of the segment objects
      in the form container/prefix. You must UTF-8-encode and then URL-encode the
      names of the container and prefix before you include them in this header.
    type: Text
  _content_encoding:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) A string representing the value of the Content-Encoding metadata.
    type: Text
  _delete_after:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) An integer representing the number of seconds after which the
      system removes the object. Internally, the Object Storage system stores this
      value in the X-Delete-At metadata item.
    type: Text
  _name:
    required: true
    help: (Required) A unique name for the object.
    type: Text
  _content_disposition:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) A string which specifies the override behavior for the browser.
      For example, this header might specify that the browser use a download program
      to save this file rather than show the file, which is the default.
    type: Text
  _detect_content_type:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) If set to true, Object Storage guesses the content type based
      on the file extension and ignores the value sent in the Content-Type header,
      if present.
    type: Text
  _content_type:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) A string which sets the MIME type for the object.
    type: Text
  _delete_at:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) An string representing the date when the system removes the object.
      For example, "2015-08-26" is equivalent to Mon, Wed, 26 Aug 2015 00:00:00 GMT.
    type: Text
  _container_name:
    required: true
    help: (Required) A unique (within an account) name for the container. The container
      name must be from 1 to 256 characters long and can start with any character
      and contain any pattern. Character set must be UTF-8. The container name cannot
      contain a slash (/) character because this character delimits the container
      and object name. For example, the path /v1/account/www/pages specifies the www
      container, not the www/pages container.
    type: Text
  _etag:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) Used to trigger updates. The only meaningful value is ${md5(file("path/to/file"))}.
    type: Text

    required: false
    help: (Optional) A string representing the name of an object used to create the
      new object by copying the @copy_from@ object. The value is in form {container}/{object}.
      You must UTF-8-encode and then URL-encode the names of the container and object
      before you include them in the header. Conflicts with @source@ and @content@
      .

    required: false

      @source@ and @copy_from@ .
