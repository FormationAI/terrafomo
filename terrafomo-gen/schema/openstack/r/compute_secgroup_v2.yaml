about: Manages a V2 security group resource within OpenStack. Please note that managing
  security groups through the OpenStack Compute API has been deprecated. Unless you
  are using an older OpenStack environment, it is recommended to use the <networking_secgroup_v2.html>
  and <networking_secgroup_rule_v2.html> resources instead, which uses the OpenStack
  Networking API.
