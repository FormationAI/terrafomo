about: This resource is experimental and may be removed in the future! Feedback is
  requested if you find this resource useful or if you find any problems with it.
  Creates a general purpose attachment connection to a Block Storage volume using
  the OpenStack Block Storage (Cinder) v2 API. Depending on your Block Storage service
  configuration, this resource can assist in attaching a volume to a non-OpenStack
  resource such as a bare-metal server or a remote virtual machine in a different
  cloud provider. This does not actually attach a volume to an instance. Please use
  the @openstack_compute_volume_attach_v2@ resource for that.
