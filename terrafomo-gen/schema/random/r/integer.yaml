about: The resource @random_integer@ generates random values from a given range, described
  by the @min@ and @max@ attributes of a given resource. This resource can be used
  in conjunction with resources that have the @create_before_destroy@ lifecycle flag
  set, to avoid conflicts with unique names during the brief period where both the
  old and new resources exist concurrently.
