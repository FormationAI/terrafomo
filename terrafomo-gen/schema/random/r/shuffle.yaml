  _result_count:

    help: (Optional) The number of results to return. Defaults to the number of items
      in the @input@ list. If fewer items are requested, some elements will be excluded
      from the result. If more items are requested, items will be repeated in the

  _seed:
    required: false
    help: ! '(Optional) Arbitrary string with which to seed the random number generator,
      in order to produce less-volatile permutations of the list. Important: Even
      with an identical seed, it is not guaranteed that the same permutation will
      be produced across different versions of Terraform. This argument causes the
      result to be less volatile , but not fixed for all time.'
