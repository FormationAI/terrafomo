about: The resource @random_pet@ generates random pet names that are intended to be
  used as unique identifiers for other resources. This resource can be used in conjunction
  with resources that have the @create_before_destroy@ lifecycle flag set, to avoid
  conflicts with unique names during the brief period where both the old and new resources
  exist concurrently.
