arguments:
  _keepers:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) Arbitrary map of values that, when changed, will trigger a new
      id to be generated. See <../index.html> for more information.
    type: Text
    deprecated: false
  _byte_length:
    required: true
    help: (Required) The number of random bytes to produce. The minimum value is 1,
      which produces eight bits of randomness.

  _prefix:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) Arbitrary string to prefix the output value with. This string
      is supplied as-is, meaning it is not guaranteed to be URL-safe or base64 encoded.

about: The resource @random_id@ generates random numbers that are intended to be used
  as unique identifiers for other resources. Unlike other resources in the "random"
  provider, this resource does use a cryptographic random number generator in order
  to minimize the chance of collisions, making the results of this resource when a
  32-byte identifier is requested of equivalent uniqueness to a type-4 UUID. This
  resource can be used in conjunction with resources that have, the @create_before_destroy@
  lifecycle flag set, to avoid conflicts with unique names during the brief period
  where both the old and new resources exist concurrently.
