- required: true
  help: The min capacity of the scalable target.
  name: min_capacity
  type: Text
- required: true
  help: The resource type and unique identifier string for the resource associated
    with the scalable target. For Amazon ECS services, this value is the resource
    type, followed by the cluster name and service name, for example,  service/default/sample-webapp
    . For Amazon EC2 Spot fleet requests, the resource type is  spot-fleet-request
    , and the identifier is the Spot fleet request ID; for example,  spot-fleet-request/sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE
    . For Amazon EMR Cluster Instance Groups, the resource type is  instancegroup
    , the identifier is the Cluster Id and the Instance Group Id; for example,  instancegroup/j-2EEZNYKUA1NTV/ig-1791Y4E1L8YI0
    .

  help: The ARN of the IAM role that allows Application AutoScaling to modify your
    scalable target on your behalf.
  name: role_arn
  type: Text
- required: true
  help: The scalable dimension of the scalable target. The scalable dimension contains
    the service namespace, resource type, and scaling property, such as  ecs:service:DesiredCount  for
    the desired task count of an Amazon ECS service, ec2:spot-fleet-request:TargetCapacity  for
    the target capacity of an Amazon EC2 Spot fleet request or elasticmapreduce:instancegroup:InstanceCount  for
    the Instance count of an EMR Cluster Instance Group.

- required: true
  help: The AWS service namespace of the scalable target. Valid values are  ecs  for
    Amazon ECS services,  ec2  Amazon EC2 Spot fleet requests and  elasticmapreduce  for
    Amazon EMR Clusters.
