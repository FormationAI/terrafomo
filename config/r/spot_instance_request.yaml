  help: The required duration for the Spot instances, in minutes. This value must
    be a multiple of 60 (60, 120, 180, 240, 300, or 360). The duration period starts
    as soon as your Spot instance receives its instance ID. At the end of the duration
    period, Amazon EC2 marks the Spot instance for termination and provides a Spot
    instance termination notice, which gives the instance a two-minute warning before
    it terminates. Note that you can't specify an Availability Zone group or a launch
    group if you specify a duration.
