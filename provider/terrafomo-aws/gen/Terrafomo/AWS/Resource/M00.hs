use a Route Table with in-line routes in conjunction with any Route
resources. Doing so will cause a conflict of rule settings and will
overwrite rules. ~> NOTE on @gateway_id@ and @nat_gateway_id@ : The AWS API
is very forgiving with these two attributes and the @aws_route_table@
resource can be created with a NAT ID specified as a Gateway ID attribute.
This will lead to a permanent diff between your configuration and statefile,
as the API returns the correct parameters in the returned route table. If
you're experiencing constant diffs in your @aws_route_table@ resources, the
first thing to check is whether or not you're specifying a NAT ID instead of
a Gateway ID, or vice-versa. ~> NOTE on @propagating_vgws@ and the
@aws_vpn_gateway_route_propagation@ resource: If the @propagating_vgws@
argument is present, it's not supported to also define route propagations
