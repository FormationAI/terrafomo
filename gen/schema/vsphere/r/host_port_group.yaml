about: The @vsphere_host_port_group@ resource can be used to manage vSphere standard
  port groups on an ESXi host. These port groups are connected to standard virtual
  switches, which can be managed by the </docs/providers/vsphere/r/host_virtual_switch.html>
  resource. For an overview on vSphere networking concepts, see <https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.networking.doc/GUID-2B11DBB8-CB3C-4AFF-8885-EFEA0FC562F4.html>
