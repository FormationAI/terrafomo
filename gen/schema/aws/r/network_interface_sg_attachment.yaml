about: This resource attaches a security group to an Elastic Network Interface (ENI).
  It can be used to attach a security group to any existing ENI, be it a secondary
  ENI or one attached as the primary interface on an instance. ~> Terraform currently
  provides the capability to assign security groups via the </docs/providers/aws/d/instance.html>
  and the </docs/providers/aws/r/network_interface.html> resources. Using this resource
  in conjunction with security groups provided in-line in those resources will cause
  conflicts, and will lead to spurious diffs and undefined behavior - please use one
  or the other.
