about: Creates an Amazon CloudFront web distribution. For information about CloudFront
  distributions, see the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html>
  . For specific information about creating CloudFront web distributions, see the
  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/APIReference/CreateDistribution.html>
  page in the Amazon CloudFront API Reference. ~> CloudFront distributions take about
  15 minutes to a deployed state after creation or modification. During this time,
  deletes to resources will be blocked. If you need to delete a distribution that
  is enabled and you do not want to wait, you need to use the @retain_on_delete@ flag.
