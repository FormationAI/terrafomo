about: Registers a custom domain name for use with AWS API Gateway. This resource
  just establishes ownership of and the TLS settings for a particular domain name.
  An API can be attached to a particular path under the registered domain name using
  <api_gateway_base_path_mapping.html> . Internally API Gateway creates a CloudFront
  distribution to route requests on the given hostname. In addition to this resource
  it's necessary to create a DNS record corresponding to the given domain name which
  is an alias (either Route53 alias or traditional CNAME) to the Cloudfront domain
  name exported in the @cloudfront_domain_name@ attribute. ~> All arguments including
  the private key will be stored in the raw state as plain-text. </docs/state/sensitive-data.html>
