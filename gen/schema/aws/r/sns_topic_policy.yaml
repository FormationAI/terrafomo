about: Provides an SNS topic policy resource ~> If a Principal is specified as just
  an AWS account ID rather than an ARN, AWS silently converts it to the ARN for the
  root user, causing future terraform plans to differ. To avoid this problem, just
  specify the full ARN, e.g. @arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root@
