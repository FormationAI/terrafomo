about: Provides a security group resource. ~> Terraform currently provides both a
  standalone <security_group_rule.html> (a single @ingress@ or @egress@ rule), and
  a Security Group resource with @ingress@ and @egress@ rules defined in-line. At
  this time you cannot use a Security Group with in-line rules in conjunction with
  any Security Group Rule resources. Doing so will cause a conflict of rule settings
  and will overwrite rules.
