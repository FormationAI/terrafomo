about: Provides a resource to manage the default AWS Security Group. For EC2 Classic
  accounts, each region comes with a Default Security Group. Additionally, each VPC
  created in AWS comes with a Default Security Group that can be managed, but not
  destroyed. , and has special caveats to be aware of when using it. Please read this
  document in its entirety before using this resource. The @aws_default_security_group@
  behaves differently from normal resources, in that Terraform does not this resource,
  but instead "adopts" it into management. We can do this because these default security
  groups cannot be destroyed, and are created with a known set of default ingress/egress
  rules. When Terraform first adopts the Default Security Group, it . It then proceeds
  to create any rules specified in the configuration. This step is required so that
  only the rules specified in the configuration are created. This resource treats
  it's inline rules as absolute; only the rules defined inline are created, and any
  additions/removals external to this resource will result in diff shown. For these
  reasons, this resource is incompatible with the @aws_security_group_rule@ resource.
  For more information about Default Security Groups, see the AWS Documentation on
  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html#default-security-group>
