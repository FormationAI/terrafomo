about: Provides a resource for subscribing to SNS topics. Requires that an SNS topic
  exist for the subscription to attach to. This resource allows you to automatically
  place messages sent to SNS topics in SQS queues, send them as HTTP(S) POST requests
  to a given endpoint, send SMS messages, or notify devices / applications. The most
  likely use case for Terraform users will probably be SQS queues.
