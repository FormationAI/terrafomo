about: ! 'Provides an RDS instance resource.  A DB instance is an isolated database
  environment in the cloud.  A DB instance can contain multiple user-created databases.
  Changes to a DB instance can occur when you manually change a parameter, such as
  @allocated_storage@ , and are reflected in the next maintenance window. Because
  of this, Terraform may report a difference in its planning phase because a modification
  has not yet taken place. You can use the @apply_immediately@ flag to instruct the
  service to apply the change immediately (see documentation below). When upgrading
  the major version of an engine, @allow_major_version_upgrade@ must be set to @true@
  . ~> Note: using @apply_immediately@ can result in a brief downtime as the server
  reboots. See the AWS Docs on <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Maintenance.html>
