    help: A code which when added to the domain as a TXT record will signal to SES
      that the owner of the domain has authorised SES to act on their behalf. The
      domain identity will be in state "verification pending" until this is done.
      See below for an example of how this might be achieved when the domain is hosted
      in Route 53 and managed by Terraform.  Find out more about verifying domains
