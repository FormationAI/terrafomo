    help: (Optional) A regex string to apply to the AMI list returned by AWS. This
      allows more advanced filtering not supported from the AWS API. This filtering
      is done locally on what AWS returns, and could have a performance impact if
      the result is large. It is recommended to combine this with other options to
      narrow down the list AWS returns.
