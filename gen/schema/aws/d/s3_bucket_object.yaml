about: The S3 object data source allows access to the metadata and (see below) content
  of an object stored inside S3 bucket. ~> The content of an object ( @body@ field)
  is available only for objects which have a human-readable @Content-Type@ ( @text/*@
  and @application/json@ ). This is to prevent printing unsafe characters and potentially
  downloading large amount of data which would be thrown away in favour of metadata.
