arguments:
  rsa_bits:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) When  @algorithm@  is "RSA", the size of the generated RSA key
      in bits. Defaults to 2048.
    type: Text
  algorithm:
    required: true
    help: (Required) The name of the algorithm to use for the key. Currently-supported
      values are "RSA" and "ECDSA".
    type: Text
  ecdsa_curve:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) When  @algorithm@  is "ECDSA", the name of the elliptic curve
      to use. May be any one of "P224", "P256", "P384" or "P521", with "P224" as the
      default.

attributes:
  algorithm:
    help: The algorithm that was selected for the key.

  private_key_pem:
    help: The private key data in PEM format.
    type: Text
  public_key_openssh:
    help: The public key data in OpenSSH  @authorized_keys@ format, if the selected
      private key format is compatible. All RSA keys are supported, and ECDSA keys
      with curves "P256", "P384" and "P251" are supported. This attribute is empty
      if an incompatible ECDSA curve is selected.
