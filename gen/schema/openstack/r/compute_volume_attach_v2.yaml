      Being able to specify a device is dependent upon the hypervisor in use. There
      is a chance that the device specified in Terraform will not be the same device
      the hypervisor chose. If this happens, Terraform will wish to update the device
      upon subsequent applying which will cause the volume to be detached and reattached
      indefinitely. Please use with caution.'
