arguments:
  port_id:

    help: (Optional) ID of an existing port with at least one IP address to associate
      with this floating IP.
    type: Text
  tenant_id:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) The target tenant ID in which to allocate the floating IP, if
      you specify this together with a port_id, make sure the target port belongs
      to the same tenant. Changing this creates a new floating IP (which may or may
      not have a different address)
    type: Text
  pool:
    required: true
    help: (Required) The name of the pool from which to obtain the floating IP. Changing
      this creates a new floating IP.

  value_specs:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) Map of additional options.
    type: Text
  region:
    required: false
    help: (Optional) The region in which to obtain the V2 Networking client. A Networking
      client is needed to create a floating IP that can be used with another networking
      resource, such as a load balancer. If omitted, the @region@ argument of the
      provider is used. Changing this creates a new floating IP (which may or may
      not have a different address).

about: Manages a V2 floating IP resource within OpenStack Neutron (networking) that
  can be used for load balancers. These are similar to Nova (compute) floating IP
  resources, but only compute floating IPs can be used with compute instances.
