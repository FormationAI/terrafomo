about: A Compute Engine Autoscaler automatically adds or removes virtual machines
  from a managed instance group based on increases or decreases in load. This allows
  your applications to gracefully handle increases in traffic and reduces cost when
  the need for resources is lower. You just define the autoscaling policy and the
  autoscaler performs automatic scaling based on the measured load. For more information,
  see <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/> and <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/autoscalers>
