about: A Compute Engine Regional Autoscaler automatically adds or removes virtual
  machines from a managed instance group based on increases or decreases in load.
  This allows your applications to gracefully handle increases in traffic and reduces
  cost when the need for resources is lower. You just define the autoscaling policy
  and the autoscaler performs automatic scaling based on the measured load. For more
  information, see <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/> and <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/regionAutoscalers>
