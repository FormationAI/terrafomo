about: ! 'Provides a GitHub repository collaborator resource. This resource allows
  you to add/remove collaborators from repositories in your organization. Collaborators
  can have explicit (and differing levels of) read, write, or administrator access
  to specific repositories in your organization, without giving the user full organization
  membership. When applied, an invitation will be sent to the user to become a collaborator
  on a repository. When destroyed, either the invitation will be cancelled or the
  collaborator will be removed from the repository. Further documentation on GitHub
