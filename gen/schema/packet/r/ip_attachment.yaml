about: Provides a resource to attach elastic IP subnets to devices. To attach an IP
  subnet from a reserved block to a provisioned device, you must derive a subnet CIDR
  belonging to one of your reserved blocks in the same project and facility as the
  target device. For example, you have reserved IPv4 address block 147.229.10.152/30,
  you can choose to assign either the whole block as one subnet to a device; or 2
  subnets with CIDRs 147.229.10.152/31' and 147.229.10.154/31; or 4 subnets with mask
  prefix length 32. More about the elastic IP subnets is <https://help.packet.net/technical/networking/elastic-ips>
  . Device and reserved block must be in the same facility.
