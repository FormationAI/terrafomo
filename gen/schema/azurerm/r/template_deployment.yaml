      forces a new resource to be created.

  deployment_mode:

    help: (Required) Specifies the mode that is used to deploy resources. This value
      could be either @Incremental@ or @Complete@ . Note that you will almost always
      want this to be set to @Incremental@ otherwise the deployment will destroy all
      infrastructure not specified within the template, and Terraform will not be
      aware of this.

about: ! 'Create a template deployment of resources ~> Note on ARM Template Deployments:
  Due to the way the underlying Azure API is designed, Terraform can only manage the
  deployment of the ARM Template - and not any resources which are created by it.
  This means that when deleting the @azurerm_template_deployment@ resource, Terraform
  will only remove the reference to the deployment, whilst leaving any resources created
  by that ARM Template Deployment. One workaround for this is to use a unique Resource
  Group for each ARM Template Deployment, which means deleting the Resource Group
  would contain any resources created within it - however this isn''t ideal. <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/resources/deployments#Deployments_Delete>
