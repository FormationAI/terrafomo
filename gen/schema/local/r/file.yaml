about: Generates a local file with the given content. ~> Note When working with local
  files, Terraform will detect the resource as having been deleted each time a configuration
  is applied on a new machine where the file is not present and will generate a diff
  to re-create it. This may cause "noise" in diffs in environments where configurations
  are routinely applied by many different users or within automation systems.
